### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Opportunities

**Q: How do I know if an auto-offer was delivered?**
A: Open the opportunity card and check the "Offer Status" section. You'll see delivery time, method, and any customer engagement (opened, clicked).

**Q: Can I send multiple offers to the same opportunity?**
A: Yes! If the first offer doesn't convert, you can send follow-up offers with different messaging or discounts.

**Q: How long should I wait before marking an opportunity as lost?**
A: Best practice is 3-5 touch points over 2-3 weeks. If no response after that, it's okay to mark as lost.

**Q: Can opportunities be automatically created?**
A: Not yet, but you can quickly create them when customers decline services. Future updates may add automatic detection.

#### Promotions

**Q: What's the difference between SMS and email promotions?**
A: SMS has higher open rates (95% vs 35%) but less space for content. Email allows rich formatting and images. Use both for maximum reach!

**Q: How often should I send promotions?**
A: No more than 1-2 per month to avoid overwhelming customers. Space promotions at least 2 weeks apart.

**Q: Can I preview how a promotion will look before sending?**
A: Yes! In the promotion creation flow, click "Preview" to see exactly what customers will receive.

**Q: Can I cancel a scheduled promotion?**
A: Yes, as long as it hasn't started sending yet. Navigate to the promotion and click "Cancel Schedule."

#### Reviews

**Q: Will negative reviews show in my dashboard?**
A: Yes, all reviews appear regardless of rating. This helps you respond promptly and address concerns.

**Q: How quickly should I respond to reviews?**
A: Aim for within 24 hours, especially for negative reviews. Quick responses show you care.

**Q: Can I edit customer reviews?**
A: No, reviews are controlled by the platform (Google, Yelp). You can only respond to them.

**Q: What if a review is fake or unfair?**
A: Flag it through the review platform's reporting system. Also respond professionally with your side of the story.

#### Loyalty

**Q: Do points expire?**
A: No, points never expire in the Dirt Free loyalty program.

**Q: Can I manually adjust customer points?**
A: Yes, admins and managers can manually award or deduct points with proper documentation.

**Q: What happens to points if a customer gets a refund?**
A: Points earned from that transaction are automatically deducted to prevent fraud.

**Q: Can customers combine points with other discounts?**
A: Yes! Points can be combined with tier discounts and promotional offers.

#### Analytics

**Q: How often do analytics update?**
A: Most metrics update in real-time. Some complex calculations refresh every 15 minutes.

**Q: Can I export analytics data?**
A: Yes! Every analytics view has an "Export" button for CSV, Excel, or PDF.

**Q: How far back does historical data go?**
A: All data from system launch is available. Typical retention is 7 years for compliance.

**Q: Why don't my numbers match [other system]?**
