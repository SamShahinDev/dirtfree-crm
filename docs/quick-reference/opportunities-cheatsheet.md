## WHAT ARE OPPORTUNITIES?

Opportunities are potential sales that didn't convert immediately. Every "no" or "maybe" deserves follow-up!

**Common Types:**
- Service Declined - Customer chose not to proceed
- Price Objection - Customer mentioned cost concerns
- Postponed Booking - Customer wants to book later
- Partial Service - Only booked part of what was recommended

## PIPELINE STAGES

| Stage | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Pending** | New, awaiting action | Auto-offer preparing or needs manual contact |
| **Offer Sent** | Automated offer delivered | Wait for customer response, track engagement |
| **Follow-up Needed** | No response to offer | Call customer personally |
| **Negotiating** | Active discussions | Continue conversation, adjust offer if needed |
| **Converted** | WON! | Link to job, celebrate the win! |

**TIP**: Drag and drop cards between columns to update status

## CONVERTING AN OPPORTUNITY

When customer agrees to book:

1. Open opportunity card
2. Click **Convert to Booking**
3. Link to job (or create new job)
4. Enter actual value
5. Add conversion notes (what worked?)
6. Click **Confirm Conversion**

**Result**: Opportunity marked WON, revenue tracked, possible loyalty points awarded

## AUTO-OFFER BEST PRACTICES

| Element | Best Practice | Why |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Discount** | 15-20% | Sweet spot for conversion vs. profit |
| **Timing** | 24-48 hours | Lets them think, not forget |
| **Delivery** | SMS + Email | Maximum reach and engagement |
| **Message** | Personal, specific | Addresses their original concern |
