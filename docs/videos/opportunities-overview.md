## Full Script

### INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)

**[SCREEN: Dashboard homepage]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Welcome to Dirt Free CRM! In this video, we'll explore one of our most powerful features: Opportunities Management. By the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to track, convert, and analyze missed sales opportunities to grow your business. Let's get started!"

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Opportunities Management - Turn Every 'No' Into a Future 'Yes'"]**

---

### SECTION 1: WHAT ARE OPPORTUNITIES? (0:30 - 1:30)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Opportunities page]**
**[CLICK: Opportunities in sidebar]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Opportunities are potential sales that didn't convert immediately but deserve follow-up. Every time a customer says 'no' or 'maybe,' that's actually an opportunity waiting to be recovered."

**[SCREEN: Opportunities dashboard showing various opportunity cards]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Common opportunity types include:"

**[TEXT CALLOUTS appear as each is mentioned:]**
- **Service Declined** - Customer decided not to proceed with quoted service
- **Price Objection** - Customer mentioned price concerns
- **Postponed Booking** - Customer wants to book later
- **Partial Service** - Only booked part of recommended service

**[SCREEN: Show statistics dashboard]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Industry studies show that following up on missed opportunities can increase your revenue by 20 to 30 percent. With Dirt Free CRM's automation, you can recover these sales without the manual effort."

### SECTION 2: CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY (1:30 - 4:00)

**[SCREEN: Opportunities page]**
**[CLICK: "+ New Opportunity" button]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Let's create an opportunity. Click the 'New Opportunity' button in the top right."

**[SCREEN: Opportunity creation form appears]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"First, select the customer. You can search by name or phone number."

**[TYPE: "John Smith" in customer search]**
**[SELECT: Customer from dropdown]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Next, choose the opportunity type. This helps us track which situations convert best."

**[CLICK: Opportunity Type dropdown]**
**[SELECT: "Price Objection"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Enter the estimated value - what would this service have been worth?"

**[TYPE: "$450" in estimated value field]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Now, here's the key: Add detailed notes about why the customer didn't book. This context is critical for follow-up."

**[TYPE: "Customer got quote for $450 for 5 rooms. Mentioned a competitor quoted $350. Seemed interested but wanted to think about it."]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Now comes the powerful part: auto-offers. Toggle this on to automatically send a special offer to the customer."

**[TOGGLE: "Auto-send offer" to ON]**
**[ANIMATION: Additional fields slide down]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Set your discount percentage - in this case, let's offer 15% off."

**[SELECT: "15%" from discount dropdown]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Choose the delivery method. SMS has the highest open rate at 95%, while email allows more detailed messaging. I recommend using both."

**[SELECT: "Both SMS & Email"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Timing is crucial. For price objections, I suggest waiting 24 hours. This gives the customer time to think, then reminds them we're here."

**[SELECT: "24 hours" from timing dropdown]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Assign the opportunity to the team member who should follow up if the auto-offer doesn't convert."

**[SELECT: Team member from dropdown]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Set a follow-up date - when should staff reach out if there's no response?"

**[SELECT: Date 5 days from now]**

**[CLOSE detail panel]**

**[PAN RIGHT: To "Follow-up Needed" column]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"'Negotiating' is for active discussions. Maybe the customer responded but wants a better offer, or has questions."

**[PAN RIGHT: To "Converted" column]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"'Converted' - this is where we celebrate! These are won deals that became actual bookings."

**[PAN RIGHT: To "Lost" column]**

**VOICEOVER:**

**[SCREEN: Show drag-and-drop in action]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Moving opportunities is simple - just drag and drop between columns as the situation changes."

### SECTION 4: CONVERTING OPPORTUNITIES (6:00 - 7:30)

**[SCREEN: Opportunity board]**
**[CLICK: An opportunity card in "Negotiating" column]**

**[SCREEN: Opportunity detail view]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Here you can see the full history: when it was created, what offers were sent, and all interactions."

**[CLICK: "Convert to Booking" button]**
**[SCREEN: Conversion dialog appears]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Click 'Convert to Booking.' Now we need to enter a few details."

**[SCREEN: Conversion form]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"If there's already a job in the system, link it here. Otherwise, you'll create the job as part of the conversion process."

**[SELECT: Existing job from dropdown]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Enter the actual value - what did they actually book for? This might be different from the estimate."

**[TYPE: "$383" - showing the discounted price]**

### SECTION 5: ANALYTICS & BEST PRACTICES (7:30 - 9:00)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Analytics > Opportunities]**
**[CLICK: Analytics in sidebar, then Opportunities tab]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Let's look at analytics to understand our opportunity performance."

**[SCREEN: Opportunities analytics dashboard]**

**[HIGHLIGHT: Conversion rate metric showing "32%"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Average deal size tells you the typical value of converted opportunities."

**[HIGHLIGHT: Average deal size showing "$425"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Time to convert shows how long it takes from opportunity creation to win. Use this to set realistic follow-up expectations."

**[HIGHLIGHT: Time to convert showing "4.5 days"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"The offer performance section is gold. It shows which discount amounts convert best."

**[SCREEN: Chart showing conversion rates by discount percentage]**
**[HIGHLIGHT: 15% discount showing highest conversion at 42%]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"See how 15% discounts convert best? That's your sweet spot - enough to motivate, but not eating too much profit."

**[SCREEN: Lost reason analysis chart]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Lost reason analysis shows why opportunities don't convert. If 'price too high' is your top reason, consider adjusting your pricing or offering better payment plans."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Best Practices"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Here are some best practices:"

**[TEXT CALLOUTS appear one by one:]**
- **"Review opportunities daily** - Stay on top of follow-ups"
- **"Personalize when needed** - Auto-offers are great, but sometimes a phone call wins"
- **"Document everything** - Every interaction helps future follow-up"
- **"Be persistent** - It takes 5 to 7 touch points to convert on average"
- **"Know when to let go** - After 3 clear 'no' responses, respect the customer's decision"
